### Setting up

After dropping the custom component into your home assistant config, you need to
supply the integration with your private keys. Modify the `device_tracker.py` file
to add your keys, as strings, in base64 format. For now, only these keys are available.

After doing this and restarting hass, log into your account by adding the "FindMy"
integration from the GUI.

This is temporary until proper GUI configuration is realized.
